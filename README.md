JHU Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: Phone Motion Sensors
===========================================================================

This course project assignment involves obtaining data from a 2012 research study on phone motion sensors
and reshaping the data. The R script run_analysis.R does all the work of reading, reshaping, and analyzing the data.
It includes feature name transformations (hard-coded) that were done externally.
Details of the data and transformations are found in CodeBook.md.
